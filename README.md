# Little Bits

## Repository Description
  Little Bits is the repository where I make my small projects available to others. 
All of the projects in this repository are single file projects that can be run by putting the source file into a compiler and pressing run.
A good place to do this without installing any extra software is replit.com :: https://docs.replit.com/getting-started/intro-replit
You can also run any of the programs in Little Bits in the IDE of your choice given the language of the project is supported by it.
## Project Descriptions

#### System Neutral Character Sheet
  Creates a class that stores information about a character related to who is playing them, who they are, how they thing and feel, and what their goals are.
  Use Case: Template for quickly creating characters using a short list of details.

#### Combat Order 
  Prints out text that meets the formatting requirments of tables in markdown.
  Has columns Name and Speed. Name is a string (any set of characters except whitespace) and Speed is an integer.
  The program starts by using preset names and speed values, then sorts the names by their associated speed values.
  In the final step, the table is printed out as the plain text verion of a markdown file.
  Use Cases: Example of formatting for markdown tables. Example tracking what order people take turns relative to eachother using a numbered list. 

#### Linear Search
  Seacrches for a predefined element in a set of integers using the linear search method. 
  Currently returns false when run as is. 
  Use Case: Theoretical: demonstrate understanding of the linear search algorithm

#### Merge Sort Algorithm
  Sorts an array of integers using the merge sort algorithm. 
  Use Case: Sort large sets of numbers quickly.

#### Molecule Builder
  Takes user input to build atoms and stores them in groups called molecules.
  Stores the type of bond between the atoms in the molecule.
  Use Case: Report information about molecules to copy into another file.
